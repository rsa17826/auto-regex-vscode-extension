Breakdown of the Regex Features Used:
Lookbehind (?<!#): Asserts that what precedes the current position is not a #.
Lookaheads (?=...): Multiple lookaheads to assert various conditions:
(?=\w): At least one word character.
(?=\S): At least one non-whitespace character.
(?=\D): At least one non-digit character.
(?=\d): At least one digit.
(?=\s): At least one whitespace character.
(?=\W): At least one non-word character.
(?=\S{5,}): At least five non-whitespace characters.
(?=\w{2,5}): Between two and five word characters.
Character Class [a-zA-Z0-9!@#$%^&*()_+={}$$$$:;"'<>,.?/~-]*`: Matches any combination of letters, digits, and special characters.
Negative Lookbehind (?<!\d): Asserts that what precedes the current position is not a digit.
More Lookaheads: Additional conditions to match:
(?=\d{2,}): At least two digits.
(?=\w{3,}): At least three word characters.
(?=\s{1,}): At least one whitespace character.
(?=\W{1,}): At least one non-word character.
(?=\D{1,}): At least one non-digit character.
(?=\S{2,}): At least two non-whitespace characters.
(?=\d{1,}): At least one digit.
Negative Lookahead (?!#): Asserts that what follows the current position is not a #.
This regex is intentionally convoluted and serves no real purpose, making it suitable for testing regex parsers.
